## 💾 Installation
The below will build and run a Docker Compose file for Elasticsearch, OpenResty (Nginx), PostgreSQL, Redis, and a NSFW/image classification server. The OpenResty build assumes you have a domain name as well as a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate. However, in order for the nginx.conf file to dynamically load your SSL certificate you will need to create a symlink to a generic "domain" folder (replace "example.com" with your domain). For local development you can skip this step.

```bash
$ ln -s /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com /etc/letsencrypt/live/domain
```

Install and run

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/jivesearch/jivesearch
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jivesearch/jivesearch/docker
$ domain=example.com && data_directory=/path/to/data && sudo mkdir -p $data_directory/elasticsearch && sudo chown 1000:1000 $data_directory/elasticsearch && sudo DATA_DIRECTORY=$data_directory ES_HEAP=2g NGINX_DOMAIN=$domain docker-compose up
```

**For local development you don't need a Let's Encrypt certificate. You can simply access http://127.0.0.1:8000 directly.** 

Elasticsearch may give you an error about max virtual memory areas. In that case:
```bash
# Add the following to the bottom of /etc/sysctl.conf:
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

For local development we recommend setting an environment variable for your !bangs to speed up loading:
```bash
export JIVESEARCH_BANGS_PATH="/path/to/file"
```
For systemd settings (replace "myuser" below and edit env variables as needed):
```bash
sudo curl -o /etc/systemd/system/frontend.service https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brentadamson/7b8117347909cc38384fed589a3d785d/raw/19a4249931adf0ea60326a6bcb89813bf328e87a/frontend
```
```bash
sudo curl -o /etc/systemd/system/images.service https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brentadamson/daafa09f8d06eb401e0eb72c2b992261/raw/357e66de29d56739ae41d61cbe227d36819e0df4/images
```
```bash
sudo curl -o /etc/systemd/system/crawler.service https://gist.githubusercontent.com/brentadamson/0880ef548130f69c2537049a550be8e8/raw/42269dfcba6d86aba49bc56ffa7e60a9eb7ebdf3/crawler
```
(The crawler is only necessary if you don't use a third-party search provider like Yandex.)


##### Wikipedia Dump File
```bash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jivesearch/jivesearch/instant/wikipedia/cmd/dumper && go run dumper.go --workers=2 --dir=/path/to/dump/files --wikipedia=true --wikidata=true --wikiquote=true --wiktionary=true --truncate=400 --delete=true
```
##### Location Data
Location data is not logged but is used for local weather

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maxmind/ppa
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install geoipupdate
$ sudo nano /usr/local/etc/GeoIP.conf
  AccountID 0
  LicenseKey 000000000000
  EditionIDs GeoLite2-City GeoLite2-Country
$ sudo crontab -e
  56 3 * * 4 /usr/bin/geoipupdate
```

##### MusicBrainz
Instructions for MusicBrainz (to show the album discography instant answer) can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/brentadamson/b711d5c9c4d974d6999876004f8bc1cd).
